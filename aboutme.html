        <p>
            With the background of Chemical engineering I was selected as part of campus placement which are quite popular in India for a very <span style="color: darkred;
            font-style: italic;">reputed IT company.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            From there on began my career as a web developer , I got trained for about 3 months in <span style="color: darkred;
            font-style: italic;">.Net development</span> but the project I got was a production support with very little exposure to development.

        </p>
        <p>
            I got the chance to work on one project for <span style="color: darkred;
            font-style: italic;"> US heathcare company </span>which had me working with<span style="color: darkred;
            font-style: italic;"> AJAX , web services and SQL.</span> Meanwhile I was very intrigued by the front end part of the website and figuring out how did it work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="color: darkred;
            font-style: italic;"> So I started with self taught courses for the front end development and this website is built from absolute scratch with HTML , CSS , CSS3 , Flexbox, Responsivensess and Javascript.</span>

            I am excited to share my portfolio with you as I grow as a designer.
